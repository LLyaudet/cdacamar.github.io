My name is **Cameron DaCamara** (pronounced Day-Camera).  I'm a C++ enthusiast, video gamer, and bad at writing descriptions about myself.

What's my goal with this?  Show off some cool C++ (and other language) stuff.  If I am able to show someone something useful through this blog I certainly count that as a win.  If someone teaches me something through this blog then I'll resent you...  *or* I'll actually thank you.  My personal value is embedded in the philosophical idea, "Knowledge parted is knowledge earned".
